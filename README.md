# Oldcord pre-refresh UI theme

This a slight edit of oldcord to change it to pre-refresh UI before the shitty discord UI update

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35b28632-6595-40f4-bc68-eb84a0c0c906)

To install with Vencord simply place "Oldcord.theme.css" into the "plugins" folder or for BetterDiscord place it in the "themes" folder

or the easiest method
Go to online themes and add this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaPiggy/oldcord/main/src/main.css

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - Enable "Sync Profile Themes" in `Settings > Accessibility` to fix broken profile colors
> - UI Density should be on default
> - To have the old gray colors, use the "Ash" theme in appearance settings
>   - If you use vencord's "Client Theme" plugin, use darker
